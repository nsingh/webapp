gather from you (by means of this website (the "Site") is used and protected and has therefore implemented 
this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to show our commitment to privacy and explain how we use and protect 
such data and information. Your use of our services and this Site is voluntary; if you do not agree with any 
of the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not submit your specimens or information or 
otherwise use our services or the Site.<br /><br />

<span class="bodyblue"><strong>Information PhyloTech May Collect From You</strong></span><br />
<br />
Information That You Voluntarily Provide: PhyloTech collects and stores the specimen data that you 
submit to the Site, as well as metadata and other information that you provide along with the specimen data 
or otherwise in connection with your use of our services.<br /><br />

User Account Information/Personally Identifiable Information: When you register for our Site and services 
and during your use of the Site and services, we may collect information that identifies you as an individual 
("personally identifiable information"), such as: your name, company or organization name, title, e-mail 
address, postal address and telephone numbers. We may also ask for billing information, including a credit 
card number, if you sign up for a fee-based account. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that 
correspondence or communication, including any personally identifiable information contained therein.
<br /><br />
Automatic Usage Information: As part of administrating the Site, we may automatically collect usage 
information. This is usage information such as the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system 
you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, pages 
you visited on our Site and usage patterns of our Site.
<br /><br />
Cookies and Tracking Pixels: We also may use cookies, tracking pixels and other similar technologies to 
track activity on our Site and to enhance the functionality of our Site. A cookie is a small amount of data that 
is sent to a browser from a web server, and gets saved on the hard drive of the computer that you are using. 
If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most 
browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting 
the transfer of a particular cookie or cookies from a particular web site to your computer. If you choose to 
reject all cookies, however, you may be unable to use those PhyloTech services that require registration or 
customization in order to participate. If you choose to accept cookies from us and our service providers, you

<br /><br />
<span class="bodyblue"><strong>Security of Your Information</strong></span><br /><br />
We take organizational, technical and administrative measures designed to protect the information you

all web pages where your personally identifiable information is collected or where you upload specimen data 
to protect its transmission over the Internet. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet 
or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so as a result, while we strive to protect your 
information, we cannot ensure the security of information you transmit to us, we transmit to you or that we 
store. If at any time you believe that your interaction with the Site is no longer secure, please let us know 
as soon as possible.
<br /><br />

are password-protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Also remember
